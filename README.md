# ![LunaZodiaco Icon](./src/LunaZodiaco.Android/Resources/mipmap-mdpi/icon.png) LunaZodiaco <!-- omit in toc -->

This cross platform - Linux, Mac OS X and Windows - F# .Net library and smartphone app calculates and shows the moon phase and the moon's zodiac at any date between the 1st of January 1900 and the 31st of December, 2099.

It calculates the ecliptic longitude of the moon (zodiac) using an algorithm from Paul Schlyter [Computing planetary positions - a tutorial with worked examples](http://stjarnhimlen.se/comp/tutorial.html) and the moon phase using the moon age calculations of [John Horton Conway](http://www.faqs.org/faqs/astronomy/faq/part3/section-15.html).

 It uses [Fabulous](https://fsprojects.github.io/Fabulous/Fabulous.XamarinForms/) as F# MVU (Elm-like) frontend to Xamarin.Forms.
